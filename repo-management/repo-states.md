# Repo States

A Chef OSS repo can be in one of 3 states
* Active
* Maintained
* Deprecated

## Active

Repos in an active state are under active development - including bug fixes, new features, and more. Repos in this active state must have at least two maintainers, who are current employees of Chef Software, Inc. SLA on response to issues or pull requests should be less than 1 business week.

## Maintained

Repos in a maintained state are maintained where bugs will be fixed, but no new feature work should be expected. Repos in this maintained state must have at least one maintainer, who is a current employee of Chef Software, Inc. SLA on response to issues or pull requests should be anywhere from 1 business week to never.

## Deprecated

Repos in a deprecated state are no longer maintained. No new features or bug fixes should be expected. Repos in this state do not have any assigned maintainers. See our [Project EOL Communication](../communication/project-eol.md) for additional information on the deprecation of a project.
