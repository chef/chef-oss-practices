# Guilds

## Summary

Guilds have formed in the Chef OSS community in order to foster a culture of learning and empathy. These guilds serve as a place where like-minded people can gather and discuss shared interests that are tangential to their projects. Currently, Chef has formed several language specific guilds (ruby, rust, go).

## Goals of the Language Guilds

  - Help establish recommended standards and styles for the language
  - Answer questions about the guild's language use within projects
  - (Mentor?)Assist new users and developers in learning the language and increasing skills

These guilds consist of multiple people, so that decisions are made democratically. The guilds also focus on creating recommended practices, though _not_ enforcement of those practices. Adoption and adherence should occur with the project teams, with documentation written about deviations from a standard or recommendation.

## Recommended Implementation

Successful language-specific guilds:
  - Have a channel for communication (e.g. #rust-guild in Slack)
  - Have periodic meetings where topics can be discussed
  - Catalog information and results of conversations in a discoverable and accessible way
