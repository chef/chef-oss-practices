# Managing Pull Requests

* Respond within the committed response time maximum
* Questions to ask when reviewing:
  * Does the PR add value?
    * Does it fix an existing issue?
    * Does it replicate work done elsewhere?
    * Does it affect in progress work?
  * Will merging it make contributions by others more difficult?
    * Merge conflicts
  * Is the code:
    * Functional
    * Safe (potentially breaking other code as well as security)
    * Maintainable
    * Compliant with _existing_ contribution and style guides
* If the PR doesn't add value:
  * Respond
  * Communicate and be supportive
    * Both of the contributor and their work
  * Always say thank you
  * Always say why
  * Explicitly close the PR
    * Even if you might look at it again in future
