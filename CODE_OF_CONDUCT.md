## Summary

Diversity is one of the greatest strengths that a community can have, and many times that strength is born from the friction that can only come through sharing differing perspectives. The goal of this document is to ensure that we create spaces welcoming to new and existing participants, and that those conversations that arise from friction are productive.

We are dedicated to providing an inclusive and harassment-free experience for anyone who participates in events or digital spaces that are organized, hosted, or managed by Chef â€“ whether that is ChefConf, Community Summits, MeetUps, training, or any online space. We do not tolerate harassment in any form.

We value the participation of each member of the Chef community and want all participants to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all participants are expected to show respect and courtesy to other participants at any Chef-related events or digital spaces, whether officially sponsored by Progress or not.

To make clear what is expected: all employees, delegates, participants, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, and volunteers at any Chef event or Chef-managed digital space are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers and moderators will enforce this code wherever appropriate.

## Code of Conduct

Chef is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, veteran status, immigration status, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of event/digital community participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience that includes people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any Chef-managed event or online platform, including talks and digital community activities.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, ageist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for any event or digital activity.

## Anti-Harassment Policy

Harassment comes in many forms, including but not limited to:

- Offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, veteran status, immigration status, or religion
- Posting/Exposing sexually explicit or violent images
- Deliberate (or implied) intimidation
- Stalking or persistent following
- Intrusive or otherwise unwanted photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Inappropriate physical contact or unwelcome sexual attention
- Posting (or threatening to post) a person's personally identifying information ("doxing")
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Further unacceptable behavior will result in escalating sanctions.

Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create an unprofessional environment.

Be careful in the words that you choose, no matter your intention with those words. Remember that sexist, racist, ageist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. If you think your conversation is making another community member uncomfortable, stop, apologize, and move forward.

For physical spaces, event staff can be asked to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your participation.

## Participants Procedure for Incident Handling in Physical Spaces

This procedure has been adopted from the Ada Initiative's guide titled "Conference anti-harassment/Responding to Reports".

All of our staff are informed of the Code of Conduct policy and guide for handling harassment at the event. Report the harassment incident (preferably in writing) to an event staff member. All reports are confidential. Please do not disclose information about the incident publicly until the staff have had sufficient time in which to address the situation. This is as much for your safety and protection as it is for the other participants. When reporting the event to staff, try to gather as much information as available, but do not interview people about the incident. Staff will assist you in writing the report/collecting information.

The important information consists of:

- Identifying information (eg. name) of the participant doing the harassing
- The behavior that was in violation
- The approximate time and date of the behavior
- The circumstances surrounding the incident
- Other people involved in the incident

If everyone is presently safe, staff will only involve law enforcement or security at a victim's request. If you do feel your safety in jeopardy, please do not hesitate to contact local law enforcement. If you do not have a cell phone, you can use any hotel phone or simply ask a staff member.

Event staff requests that they be your first resource when reporting an incident, so that they may enforce the Code of Conduct and take quick action toward a resolution.

If at all possible, all reports should be made directly to the team responsible, listed under [Contact Information](#Contact-Information).

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be reported by contacting any of the Community Organizers [listed below](#Contact-Information) directly. All complaints will be reviewed, investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Community Organizers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Anyone who is asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

Crafting a list of punitive actions would be inadequate and incomplete. Each incident will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

Our first response should always be to ensure the immediate safety and well being of all parties involved. In the ideal case, an attempt to stop and prevent the violating behavior would be made before any punitive action is decided.

When punitive action is warranted, one or more of the following remedies may be used:

- Expulsion from the space where the incident occurred with no refund
- Removal from the space where the incident occurred for a period of time
- Banned from the space where the incident occurred indefinitely
- Banned from one or more upcoming events

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers will take action that they deem appropriate -- up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community _without warning_ (and without refund, in the case of a paid event). If you have been involved in unacceptable behavior with current Chef community members outside the boundaries of the Chef Community, the Community Organizers retain the right to treat those external incidents in the same manner as internal incidents.

Any physical violence _or_ intimidation, threatened or acted on, is a serious offense and will result in immediate exclusion from the community and appropriate follow up with law enforcement.

## Our Responsibilities

Community Organizers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Community Organizers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, messages, tweets, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct (in letter or in spirit), or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Contact Information

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a Community organizer.

The following are the various roles of our Community Organizers and the person(s) assigned to each role:

- The Deciders have final say on community guidelines and final authority on correct actions and appeals
- The Community Organizers may be assigned for each area where the community convenes online (Slack, email list, GitHub, etc.). Community Organizers are employees of Progress. They act in good faith to help enforce our community guidelines and respond to incidents when they occur
- A Community Member is anyone who participates with the community whether in-person or via online channels. Community members are responsible for following the community guidelines, suggesting updates to the guidelines when warranted, and helping enforce community guidelines

## Scope

Our community will convene in both physical and digital spaces. This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by community organizers as needed.
