# Role of Decider

Chef's previous "decider" for all Chef Open Source projects was Adam Jacob. This worked extremely well when Chef had a single major open source project. With the expansion of Chef's Open Source footprint, having one person in charge of decisions for all projects is no longer sustainable or desirable. Due to this, the role has been eliminated.

Decisions about the direction of Chef Open Source projects (including but not limited to Chef, InSpec, Habitat, and Automate) are now at the discretion of the individual project owner(s) and the product manager(s) assigned to those projects. We welcome input from all and encourage community members to express opinions on the directions of projects through GitHub or the Chef Discourse forums. We will gladly consider any input and feedback that is offered, but reserve the right to decide whether and how to act on that feedback.
