# Community Meetings

Community Meetings are held in text form in the #community-meetings channel of the Chef Community Slack every Thursday at 9 AM Pacific.

Meetings are scheduled for 45 minutes.

## Requirements

* Meetings are open to anyone who is interested.
* Each meeting must have a designated leader.
* Each meeting must have an agenda posted in #community-meetings prior to the meeting from the GitHub repo at https://github.com/chef/chef-community-slack-meetings. Agendas should have draft time slots for each topic.
* Putting together the meeting agenda is the responsibility of the designated leader.
* The meeting leader will start the meeting with a greeting and any Chef announcements (ChefConf, Community Summits, etc.).
* Each meeting must have at least one representative from Chef's major Open Source projects - including Chef, Habitat, InSpec, and Automate.
* Each representative will give a brief update on the project - what is being worked on, issues that they would like to solicit input on, etc.
* The meeting will then open for general discussion.
* As an agenda item nears its time limit, the moderator will give a 2 minute warning, then close the topic.
* All Chef engineers - engineers employed by Chef Software, Inc. - are highly encouraged to attend.
