# Communication

The Chef Community is committed to keeping our space a fun, safe, and productive place to be, so please review the Community [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before getting started. In general:

- *Be Kind.* We get more done when people are helpful and respectful of one another. Plus, it feels better.
- *Listen.* Try to understand someone's position before you negate a suggestion or idea. Ask clarifying questions if something doesn't make sense to you.
- *Be Patient.* We have no team dedicated solely to Community support, so responses will be semi-synchronous, or, more likely, asynchronous. Know that the Community appreciates all your contributions, and we're working to be as responsive as possible.

## Reporting Code of Conduct Violations

Please directly email one of the Community Advocates listed in the [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Please email security@chef.io to report security vulnerabilities.

## Communication Channels

We have four communication channels, each with its own specific purpose.

If you have questions about why we choose to use certain channels in certain ways, please check out the [Frequently Asked Questions](communication-faq.md).

### GitHub

GitHub is the Chef Community's preferred durable medium for open and transparent development of software. All development conversation must be captured in GitHub. Any decisions made in internal Chef Slack channels, Zoom sessions, or any other communication medium must be summarized in GitHub. [The exact format for adding this info to GitHub is TBD.] Please also link to the GitHub issue or pull request in chat once it is opened.

### Community Slack

 Sometimes it will make sense to have a brief, non-durable conversation about the development of a project. Have these exchanges in Community Slack (either in a dev channel or via DM). Then, any development decisions, etc. arising from the Slack interaction should be documented in GitHub. Limit these conversations in Community Slack to development for a given project.

### Mailing Lists

The Chef Community mailing lists are hosted via [Discourse](https://discourse.chef.io/). This is the best place to catch up on general and security-related announcements.

### Office Hours

Individual projects may host office hours on a periodic basis. This is a great way to get some face time with other Project Members. Each project should record and archive sessions to a public location; see individual project documentation for more details.

**Note:** Zoom is a good medium for office hours. Google Hangouts via YouTube is another great option for these calls for a number of reasons. It will allow all members of a team appropriate admin rights to schedule/start/stop the call, it has both a public viewing link and private invite link, and the calls can automatically be recorded and uploaded to a YouTube channel on completion.

## Providing Support

Please see our [support boundaries](support-boundaries.md) doc regarding the types of support that are provided by maintainers and the types of support that are not.
