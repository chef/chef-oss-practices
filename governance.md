This is a Work in Progress, documenting approximately how we believe we should be operating.

# Principles

The Chef OSS communities adhere to the following principles:

  - Open: All Chef software is open source. See repository guidelines and DCO information below.
  - Welcoming and respectful: See Code of Conduct below.
  - Transparent and accessible: Work and collaboration should be done in public. See team governance below.
  - Benefit: Ideas and contributions are accepted according to their technical benefit and alignment with project objectives, scope, and design principles.

## Code of Conduct

All members of the Chef community, including employees, must abide by the Chef Code of Conduct. For the complete text, see the [Chef Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Project Membership

Please refer to [Project Membership](project-membership.md) for more information.

## Community Groups

The Chef OSS Communities have 3 main types of groups:

  - Teams
  - Guilds
  - Committees

### Teams

Teams are sets of people within an individual project that focus on various parts of that project. Teams _must_ have open and transparent proceedings and communication. Anyone is welcome to participate and contribute to a team, provided they follow the Chef OSS Code of Conduct and read to understand the team's governance policy.

### Guilds

[Guilds](guilds/README.MD) are groups of individuals with shared interests in specific subjects that may be tangential to the project they are a member of. The purpose of guilds is to provide knowledge cross-pollination as well as establish standards and practices within the scope of the interest to the larger community. These can be anything from a group sharing knowledge on a specific language - e.g. the Go guild - to a group discussing the merits of various web frameworks - e.g. the Web Guild - and anything in between.

### Committees

Committees are named sets of people that are chartered to take on sensitive or specific topics. This group type is encouraged to be as open as possible while achieving its mission, but some private communication is expected because of the potential sensitive nature of the topics discussed.

## Repository Guidelines

All new repositories under the Chef, Habitat, or Inspec GitHub orgs should follow the processes outlined in the [Chef OSS repository guidelines](repo-management/README.md).

## DCO

This project uses a [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](DCO.md) to ensure that each commit was written by the author or that the author has the appropriate rights necessary to contribute the change.

## End of Life for a Project

Sometimes in the life of a project, there comes a time where the humans contributing to it have reasons to stop. Maybe a new project is developed that solves the original problem better. Maybe the humans have other priorities in their life. Whatever the reason, we intend for the project to clearly communicate how well-supported it is.

For Chef Software (the company) to continue providing resources to a project, there must be two or more Chef employees active in the project. At a point where Chef Software has decided to reduce or end involvement with a project under its purview, the project owners will make announcements, post notices, and archive the repository in according to the [communication plan for project end-of-life](communication/project-eol.md).
