# Contributor Entitlement Program

Continuing our commitment to work in partnership with the Chef Community, Chef offers a Contributor Entitlement program.  At Chef, we recognize and value our community's involvement and we are dedicated to enabling our contributors to use the very software they are helping to build.

Chef considers any of the following contributions to be qualifying to apply to the Contributor Entitlement program:

```text
Publish and maintain at least 5 distinct content items
    This could include Habitat Core Plans, InSpec Profiles, or Chef Community Cookbooks
Submit, and have approved and merged, at least 5 PRs or Patches for the core Chef projects per year
    We consider the core projects to be Chef Infra, Chef InSpec, Chef Habitat, and Chef Automate
Contribute and publish at least 10 meaningful contributions to official Chef documentation per year
```

Each qualifying account will be granted the equivalent of $15,000 USD of license entitlement (subject to review of your commercial relationship with Chef, should one exist). This gives our contributors the flexibility of deciding how best to apply the credit as it works for their business.  So feel free to use it on any combination of Chef products; we ask only that it be declared as part of the contract. We also require that entitlements be claimed within 12 months of the most recent qualifying contribution and be renewed annually. Thus, even though the entitlement expires annually, any ongoing contributions would qualify contributors to renew their contributor entitlement.
