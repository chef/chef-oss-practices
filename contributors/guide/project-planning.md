# Project Planning

Long term project planning, which is different from [triage and prioritization](issue-triage.md), is done through Aha! and GitHub.

## Aha!

[Aha!](https://www.aha.io/) is an internal Chef tool used by our Product, Product Operations, and Engineering Leadership teams. This is a place to track high level work and the state of that work. Features are prioritized in Aha! based on business priorities, as well as feedback from our customers and community. Roadmaps created in Aha! will be shared publicly. Feedback on the roadmap is welcome through GitHub as well as other ways, which are still to be decided.

Aha! does have integrations with GitHub, which are still being tested at this time, so that work can be synced between the two tools.

Any work involving confidential customer information or confidential business strategy is tracked in Aha!

## GitHub

[GitHub](http://www.github.com) tracks all work from the Engineering level down. Once work is turned into features/tasks/etc. in Aha!, it must be synced to GitHub. There is automation that allows this, though it is still being proven out. Work can also be manually synced if necessary. No confidential customer or business strategy information should ever be placed in GitHub.

### ZenHub

[ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/) is a wrapper around GitHub issues that allows for epic tracking and multi-repo boards. Epics must be synced between ZenHub and Aha! and the GitHub integration should allow for this syncing.
