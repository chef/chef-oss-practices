# Distributions

Along with the [official Chef distributions](https://downloads.chef.io/) of our Open Source projects, members of our community have created alternative distributions of Chef's Open Source products. These are listed below.

## Cinc

The Cinc project currently includes community distributions of Chef Infra Client (Cinc Client) and Chef InSpec (Cinc Auditor).

## Biome

This is a community distribution of Habitat.

Not technically a community distribution, Goiardi is a feature-limited implementation of Chef Server, written in [Go](https://golang.org/).
